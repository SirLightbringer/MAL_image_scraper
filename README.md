# MAL Image Scraper

This is pretty basic image scraper to grab anime character images from a given URL. 

Performance has been considerably sped up to synchronous scraping with the use of the asyncio and aiohttp libraries.
Other methods of the MALScraper class have not been optimised.

Compiled to EXE for anyone who wants to run too. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/SilentHacks/MAL_image_scraper/releases).
